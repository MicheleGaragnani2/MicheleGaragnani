      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>I am a post-doctoral researcher at Bocconi University.
I am a neuroeconomist studying how basic processes interact to produce complex economic behavior.
I am an interdisciplinary researcher between (micro)economics, psychology, and (decision) neuroscience.
I received my PhD from the University of Zurich under the supervision of Prof. Carlos Al√≥s-Ferrer and Prof. Ernst Fehr.</p>  

<p>My research aims to formulate and test models of human behavior which accurately predict choices and process data (response times, neural activity, etc.), with the ultimate aim of helping people make better decisions.</p>
